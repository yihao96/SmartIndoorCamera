This is a Final Year Project for my course BSc in Information Technology with specialism in Mobile Technology.

The project consist of two parts; a mobile application for Android and an application for Android Things 
to be run on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B with Android Things OS.

The Raspberry Pi 3 Model B is paired with Raspi Camera, USB microphone, a PIR motion sensor, and a button to trigger Google Assistant.
